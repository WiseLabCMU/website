Tire wear affects safety and performance of automobiles. Past solutions are either inaccurate, requires sensors embedded in tires or are prone to road debris. Osprey proposes a sensor system design based on automotive mmWave radars and designs algorithms to measure tire wear while overcoming challenges related to road debris. In addition, the principles used also open up solutions for detecting and localizing harmful metallic foreign objects in the tire.
