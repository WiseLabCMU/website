Current state-of-the-art AR and VR systems show tremendous promise in applications 
ranging from entertainment and telerobotics, to pervasive computing and telepresence. 
Unfortunately, existing systems remain largely decoupled from the physical world, 
interactivity remains cumbersome and imprecise for end users, and participants lack 
a realistic representation of themselves. High-fidelity 3D acquisition and processing 
of physical environments, objects, and human performances are still bound to 
computation-intensive workflows, and live streaming is only possible with dedicated 
high-throughput network infrastructure as well as professional capture studios. We are 
working to bridge this gap by developing the infrastructure that makes virtual objects both 
persistent across space and time and accessible to multiple users at once.
