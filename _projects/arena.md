Many have predicted the future of the Web to be the integration of Web content with the real-world through technologies such as augmented reality. This overlay of virtual content on top of the physical world, called the Spatial Web (in different contexts might be called AR Cloud, MetaVerse, Digital Twin), holds promise for dramatically changing the Internet as we see it today, and has broad application.

Building pervasive mixed reality applications is challenging for several reasons, such as: (i) applications require global instant-on localization; (ii) ideally, multiple users should interact with the content; (iii) tight latency requirements; (iv) diversity of compute and interaction capabilities.

The ARENA addresses the challenges of building collaborative mixed reality applications. It is a network-transparent runtime system that uses web-based technologies to host multiple independent applications that can be accessed simultaneously by multiple users.

See the [ARENA main website](https://arenaxr.org/).

The ARENA is being developed within the [CONIX Research Center](https://conix.io/).
