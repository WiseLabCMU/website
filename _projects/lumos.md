Hidden IoT devices are increasingly being used to snoop
on users in hotel rooms or AirBnBs. We envision empowering
users entering such unfamiliar environments to identify and
locate (e.g., hidden camera behind plants) diverse hidden
devices (e.g., cameras, microphones, speakers) using only
their personal handhelds. What makes this challenging is the
limited network visibility and physical access that a user has
in such unfamiliar environments, coupled with the lack of
specialized equipment. In this project we present Lumos, a system
that runs on commodity user devices (e.g., phone, laptop)
and enables users to identify and locate WiFi-connected
hidden IoT devices and visualize their presence using an
augmented reality (AR) interface.
