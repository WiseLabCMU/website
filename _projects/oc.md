OpenChirp is a management framework on top of LoRaWAN that provides data context, storage, visualization, and access control over the web. LoRaWAN is an emerging Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LP-WAN) protocol designed to support battery-operated devices that want to send just a few bytes of data but over long distances. Devices typically transmit 1-2km in urban areas and up to 15km in open space. OpenChirp is currently powering a LoRaWAN Network that started at Carnegie Mellon University but has spread to the City of Pittsburgh and beyond.
