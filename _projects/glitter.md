One of the major challenges faced by Augmented Reality (AR) systems is linking virtual content accurately on physical objects and locations. This problem is amplified for applications like mobile payment, device control or secure pairing that requires authentication. In this project, we present an active LED tag system called GLITTER that uses a combination of Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) and modulated LEDs to anchor AR content with no a priori training or labeling of an environment. Unlike traditional optical markers that encode data spatially, each active optical marker encodes a tagâ€™s identifier by blinking over time, improving both the tag density and range compared to AR tags and QR codes.
